# Authentication & Authorization System Design

**Difficulty Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Hard  
**Tags:** `Security`, `Identity Management`, `OAuth 2.0`, `JWT`, `SSO`, `Distributed Systems`, `Encryption`, `Access Control`, `Multi-Factor Authentication`, `SAML`

**File Purpose:** Interactive, multi-level learning resource for designing an enterprise-grade Authentication and Authorization system. This instructional guide takes you from beginner concepts to advanced production considerations, teaching you how to build a system that handles 10M+ users, processes 100K authentication requests per second, supports multiple protocols (OAuth 2.0, SAML, OIDC), achieves 99.99% availability, and maintains <50ms token validation latency.

## 🎓 Welcome to Authentication & Authorization System Design!

### What You're Going to Build

Imagine creating the security backbone for a major enterprise like Okta, Auth0, or AWS Cognito - a service that securely verifies who users are (authentication) and what they're allowed to do (authorization). 

By the end of this learning journey, you'll understand how to design a production-grade authentication and authorization system that:
- Handles millions of users across multiple applications
- Supports modern protocols like OAuth 2.0, SAML, and OpenID Connect
- Validates tokens in under 50 milliseconds
- Implements multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security
- Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications
- Scales globally across multiple data centers
- Stays available 99.99% of the time (that's only 52 minutes of downtime per year!)
- Protects against common security threats (brute force, token theft, session hijacking)

### 📚 Your Learning Path

This course is designed for three different learning levels. You can progress through all levels or focus on the one that matches your current needs:

```text
🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL (6-8 hours)
├─ Learn fundamental security concepts
├─ Understand authentication vs authorization
├─ Build intuition with everyday analogies
└─ Perfect for: New to security and system design

🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (8-10 hours)  
├─ Master OAuth 2.0, JWT, and SAML protocols
├─ Learn authorization models (RBAC, ABAC)
├─ Practice common interview questions
└─ Perfect for: Preparing for FAANG interviews

🔴 ADVANCED LEVEL (10-15 hours)
├─ Production security considerations
├─ Token management at scale
├─ Handle edge cases and security threats
└─ Perfect for: Senior engineers and security architects
```

### 🎯 Prerequisites

**For Beginners:**
- Basic understanding of HTTP and web requests
- Familiarity with usernames and passwords
- Understanding of what an API is
- No prior security experience needed!

**For Intermediate:**
- Comfortable with REST APIs and HTTP headers
- Understanding of cryptography basics (hashing, encryption)
- Familiarity with tokens and sessions
- Basic knowledge of distributed systems

**For Advanced:**
- Experience building secure systems
- Knowledge of cryptographic protocols
- Understanding of distributed systems and consistency models
- Familiarity with compliance standards (GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001)

### 📊 What Makes This Learning Experience Unique

Each section follows a proven learning pattern:
1. **What You'll Learn** - Clear learning objectives
2. **Why This Matters** - Real-world security context
3. **Multi-Level Content** - Tailored explanations for your level
4. **Real-World Examples** - How Auth0, Okta, and AWS Cognito actually do it
5. **Security Considerations** - Common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them
6. **Think About It** - Questions to deepen understanding
7. **Key Takeaways** - Summary of main points
8. **Practice Exercise** - Hands-on security challenges

💡 **Pro Tip:** Security is critical! Don't skip the "Security Considerations" sections - they cover vulnerabilities that can lead to major breaches!
